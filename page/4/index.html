<p>May 4th 2023</p>
<p>For a public demonstration of the importance of ritual, the coronation of King Charles III on May 6th will be hard to beat. The ceremony will take place at Westminster Abbey, where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066. There will be anointing, homage-paying, oath-taking and all manner of processing. In any other circumstances this kind of behaviour would warrant a medical diagnosis. But the alchemy of tradition means that it will instead <strong>call forth</strong> a sense of continuity and the idea of shared history. </p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">【1】call forth 引起</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>就公开展示仪式的重要性而言，5月6日国王查尔斯三世的加冕典礼将是无可比拟的。加冕典礼将在威斯敏斯特教堂举行，自1066年征服者威廉以来，这里一直是君主加冕的地方。这里将会有涂油、致敬、加冕宣誓以及各种各样的仪式。在任何其他情况下，这种行为都需要有医疗诊断。但传统的魔力意味着，它反而会唤起一种延续性和共同历史的观念。</p>
<p>Rituals are also a big part of corporate life. There is nothing to match coronation levels of weirdness, much as some chief executives might like the idea of robes and a throne. But firms have their own ceremonies and rites. Some are internal: the repetitive rhythms of performance reviews and weekly meetings, budget processes and farewell cards are all ritualistic. Others are more public, from investor days to conference calls with analysts. The pandemic spawned a host of new customs, from regular events designed to lure people into the office to dedicated times of the week devoted to concentrated work.</p>
<p>仪式也是公司生活的重要组成部分。没有什么能与加冕仪式的怪异程度相提并论，就像一些首席执行官可能喜欢长袍和宝座的想法一样。但公司有自己的仪式。有些仪式是内部的: 循环往复的绩效评估、每周例会、预算流程以及告别卡都是仪式性的。其他仪式则更为公开，从投资者日到分析师电话会议。疫情催生了许多新习俗，从旨在吸引人们进入办公室的定期事件，到每周专门用于集中工作的时间。</p>
<p>Business rituals can arise spontaneously—those informal games of office bingo for when the boss uses their favourite bit of jargon. They can also be entirely private. No rule exists to say that, on entering a hotel room, the business traveller must check the minibar; that if the hotel manager has written a letter welcoming him, he must feel absurdly pleased; that if there is a plate of fruit, he must immediately eat all of it. Yet all of these things are as if ordained.</p>
<p>企业仪式可能会自然而然产生–即当老板使用他们最喜欢的行话，产生的那种非正式的办公室宾果游戏。企业仪式也可以是完全私人的。没有规定要求，商务旅客在进入酒店房间时必须检查迷你吧（宾馆房间内放饮料的小冰箱）; 如果酒店经理写了一封信欢迎他，他一定要感到无比的高兴; 如果有一盘水果，他必须立即吃完。然而这一切似乎都是命中注定的。</p>
<p>The prime example of the set-piece ceremony is the annual shareholders’ meeting. As a way of getting things done, this format is dreadful. Any information that shareholders actually need is available to them elsewhere. Many people delegate their voting rights to others. Plenty come just for the sandwiches. </p>
<p>固定仪式的典型例子是年度股东大会。作为一种完成任务的方式，这种形式很糟糕。股东真正需要的任何信息都可以在其他地方找得到。许多人把投票权委托给别人。很多人只是为了三明治而来。</p>
<p>But as a ritual it matters. The board of directors enter and sit on a podium; some of them may say absolutely nothing. The bosses give presentations to show that shareholders could not wish for a better set of managers. A succession of small shareholders then take the microphone and harangue the company’s management for being totally useless. It is performative, to be sure, but a bit of a performance doesn’t go amiss for something as bloodless as corporate governance. The annual meeting offers a useful physical reminder of who is accountable to whom. </p>
<p>但作为一种仪式，这很重要。董事会成员进场，坐在讲台上；有些人可能什么也不说。老板们发表演讲，以向股东们展示着不会有更好的管理者了。接着，一群小股东拿起麦克风，痛骂公司管理层一无是处。可以肯定的是，这是表演性的，但对于像公司治理这样“不流血”的东西来说，一点点表演也没什么错。年会提供了一个有用的实物提醒，即提醒人们谁对谁负责。</p>
<p>Standard rites of this sort can evolve into company-specific ones. Amazon has attached a copy of its very first letter to shareholders, from 1997, to every one it has published since as a way of demonstrating that an underlying ethos endures even as the world around it changes. </p>
<p>这种标准仪式可以演变成公司特有的仪式。亚马逊自1997年以来发布的每一封致股东信都附上了其第一封致股东信的副本，以表明即使周围的世界发生变化，一种潜在的精神依然存在。</p>
<p>Rituals are also used as a way of building culture and team spirit. The financial industry has a long-established custom of giving “tombstones” out to clients and bankers when a transaction closes. The original tombstones were ads in newspapers, so called because they were laid out in a way that resembled gravestone inscriptions. The modern versions are sometimes known as “deal toys”. Lucite may not have much intrinsic value but the ritual survives as part-reward, part-commemoration, part-brag. Plenty of firms have less involved celebratory rites, like ringing bells or banging gongs when they hit certain sales milestones. </p>
<p>仪式也被用作建立文化和团队精神的一种方式。金融行业有一个由来已久的习俗，即在交易结束时向客户和银行家赠送“tombstones”。最初的纪念品（墓碑）是报纸上的广告，之所以这么叫，是因为它们的摆放方式类似于墓碑上的铭文。现代版本有时被称为“deal toys”。奖杯可能没有太多的内在价值，但这种仪式作为奖励、纪念和炫耀而存在。许多公司没有那么多的庆祝仪式，比如当他们达到某个销售里程碑时敲钟或敲锣。</p>
<p>Even simple rituals can encourage a sense of community and purpose among employees. A paper published in 2021 by Tami Kim of the University of Virginia and her co-authors asked volunteers to participate in a set of physical movements before starting out on a brainstorming exercise. Some looked at each other during this warm-up and others did not. The people who maintained eye contact rated the subsequent brainstorming as more meaningful.</p>
<p>即使是简单的仪式也能激发员工的社区意识和使命感。弗吉尼亚大学的塔米·金和她的共同作者在2021年发表了一篇论文，要求志愿者在开始头脑风暴练习之前参加一系列身体运动。有些人在热身过程中互相看着对方，有些人则没有。保持眼神交流的人认为随后的头脑风暴更有意义。</p>
<p>But turning everything into a ritual also risks being tiresome. The only thing worse than an unnecessary meeting is an unnecessary meeting with stretching beforehand. Hosting colleagues at a regular meal and calling it “Fabulous Friday” is going to be most appealing to those who would otherwise be having a “Friendless Friday”. And one person’s ritual is another person’s ordeal. Ms Kim’s paper mentions a digital agency that holds regular sessions in which employees share personal stories about moments that changed their lives. This is indeed a ritual, but so is hanging, drawing and quartering. If there is a golden rule of corporate ritual, it is that it should make people feel as if they belong. ■</p>
<p>但把所有事情都变成一种仪式也有让人厌烦的风险。唯一比不必要的会议更糟糕的是，一场不必要的会议在开始前就拉长了。定期招待同事吃饭，并称之为“美妙的星期五”，这对那些本来要度过一个“没有朋友的星期五”的人来说将是最有吸引力的。一个人的仪式就是另一个人的折磨。金的论文提到了一家数字代理公司，该公司定期举行会议，让员工分享改变他们生活的个人故事。这确实是一种仪式，但这也是绞死并开膛分尸的仪式。如果说公司礼仪有什么金科玉律的话，那就是它应该让人们有归属感。■</p>

<p><strong>Too many people take too many pills</strong></p>
<p>太多的人吃了太多的药</p>
<p>Overprescribing drugs</p>
<p>![image-20230504095831892](&#x2F;Users&#x2F;chenyujie&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;typora-user-images&#x2F;image-20230504095831892.png)</p>
<p><strong>Medical systems are set up to put people on drugs, not take them off</strong></p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">overprescribe （没有必要地）开药过于频繁</span><br><span class="line">【释义】to prescribe (= give as a medical treatment) a particular drug too often, when it is not necessary</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>医疗系统的建立是为了让人们服药，而不是停药</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>s a pharmacist in a big hospital in Adelaide, Emily Reeve would often see patients overwhelmed by the number of drugs they took each day. “They’d say ‘I take so many medicines that I rattle when I walk’,” she recalls. And she worried that some of the medications these patients were on seemed useless, or even harmful.</p>
<p>作为阿德莱德一家大医院的药剂师，艾米丽·里夫经常看到病人被每天服用的药物数量“压垮”。她回忆说:“他们会说‘我要吃的药太多了，以至于我走路的时候都发出嘎嘎声’。”她担心这些病人服用的一些药物似乎毫无用处，甚至是有害的。</p>
<p>Dr Reeve’s patients are not unusual, at least in the rich world. About 15% of people in England take five or more prescription drugs every day. So do 20% of Americans and Canadians aged 40-79. Since the old tend to be sicker, the number of pills a person pops tends to rise over time. Of Americans who are 65 or older, two-thirds take at least five medications each day. In Canada, a quarter of over-65s take ten or more.</p>
<p>里夫医生的病人的情况很常见，至少在发达国家是这样。在英国，大约15%的人每天服用五种或更多的处方药。在40-79岁的美国人和加拿大人中，这一比例为20%。由于老年人往往病情更重，他们服用的药物数量往往会随着年龄的推移而增加。65岁以上的美国人中，三分之二的人每天至少服用五种药物。在加拿大，四分之一的65岁以上的人服用10种或更多的药物。</p>
<p>Not all those prescriptions are beneficial. Half of older Canadians take at least one that is, in some way, inappropriate. A review of overprescribing in England in 2021 concluded that at least 10% of prescriptions handed out by family doctors, pharmacists and the like should probably not have been issued. And even properly prescribed drugs have side effects. The more medicines someone takes, the more they will experience.</p>
<p>并非所有这些处方上开的药都是有益的。一半的加拿大老年人至少会选择一种在某种程度上不合适的药物。2021年，英国一份关于过量开药的审查得出结论，家庭医生、药剂师等开具的处方中，至少有10%可能不应该开出。甚至是正确的处方药物也有副作用。一个人吃的药越多，他经历的副作用就越多。</p>
<p>“Polypharmacy”, as doctors call it, imposes a big drag on health. A recent study at a hospital in Liverpool found that nearly one in five hospital admissions was caused by adverse reactions to drugs. The Lown Institute, an American think-tank, reckons that, between 2020 and 2030, medication overload in America could cause more than 150,000 premature deaths and 4.5m hospital admissions.</p>
<p>医生所谓的“多药疗法”严重影响了健康。利物浦一家医院最近的一项研究发现，近五分之一的住院患者是由药物不良反应引起的。美国智库洛恩研究所估计，在2020年至2030年之间，美国的药物过量情况可能导致超过15万人过早死亡，450万人住院。</p>
<p>Getting people off drugs is unfamiliar terrain for modern health systems, which are mostly set up to put patients on them. But that is beginning to change. Doctors, pharmacists and nurses are setting up “deprescribing networks” to try to spread the word. (Dr Reeve, now at Monash University, in Melbourne, runs one in Australia.) England’s National Health Service published a plan to reduce overprescribing in 2021. The first international conference on it took place last year, in Denmark.</p>
<p>让人们免受药物之罪对现代卫生系统来说是一个陌生的领域，因为现代卫生系统大多是为了让病人服用药物而建立的。但这种情况正在开始改变。医生、药剂师和护士正在建立“去处方药物的网络”以试图传播这一信息。(现就职于墨尔本莫纳什大学的里夫博士在澳大利亚也建立了一个。) 英国国家医疗服务体系在2021年公布了一项减少厨房过度开药的计划。去年在丹麦第一次召开了关于这个问题的国际会议。</p>
<p>Excessive pill-popping burdens patients in several ways. One is the sheer logistics of it all. “People feel like their entire lives revolve around their medications,” says Michael Steinman, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. The more drugs someone takes, the greater the chances are that some of them will be taken wrongly.</p>
<p>过量服药给患者带来了几个方面的负担。一方面完全是“后勤”问题。“人们觉得他们的整个生活都围绕着他们的药物，”加州大学旧金山分校的医学教授迈克尔·斯坦曼说。一个人服用的药物越多，其中一些药物被误服的可能性就越大。</p>
<p>Other problems are more straightforwardly medical. Some patients end up taking several drugs that affect the same biological pathway. One example is anticholinergics, which suppress the activity of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Several drugs, including some anti-allergy pills, anti-incontinence drugs and tricyclic antidepressants, work this way. But doctors are not always aware of that, says Dr Reeve.</p>
<p>其他问题更直接地与医学相关。一些患者最终服用了几种影响同一生物途径的药物。抗胆碱能药物就是一个例子，它能抑制乙酰胆碱(一种神经递质)的活性。包括抗过敏药、抗失禁药和三环类抗抑郁药在内的一些药都是作用于这一途径。但医生们并不总是能意识到这一点，里夫博士说道。</p>
<p>The pills won’t help you now</p>
<p>That can cause overdosing. Loading up on anticholinergics can suppress acetylcholine so strongly that it can leave patients stupefied or confused. Often such effects are wrongly ascribed to old age, or to disease. By cutting away problematic drugs, “we’ve had incidents where we have been able to reverse the [incorrect] diagnosis of dementia,” says Barbara Farrell, an academic and pharmacist at the Bruyere Research Institute in Canada.</p>
<p>这可能会导致过量服用药物。大量服用抗胆碱能药物可以强烈地抑制乙酰胆碱，从而使患者变得麻木或困惑。这种影响常常被错误地归咎于年老或疾病。加拿大布鲁耶尔研究所的学者和药剂师芭芭拉·法雷尔说，通过“去除”有问题的药物，“我们已经能够扭转对痴呆症的[错误]诊断。”</p>
<p>Overprescribing can become self-reinforcing, says Dr Steinman. Several common drugs block reabsorption of serotonin, another neurotransmitter. Taking too many can cause tremors, insomnia and jerky movements of the arms and legs. Those symptoms are often mistaken for Parkinson’s disease. So drugs for Parkinson’s are added, in what is known as a “prescribing cascade”. These, in turn, can cause low blood pressure and delirium–which are, of course, treated with yet more drugs.</p>
<p>斯坦曼称，过度开处方会变得自我强化。几种常用药物会阻止血清素(另一种神经递质)的再吸收。服用过多会导致颤抖、失眠和手脚抽搐。这些症状经常被误认为是帕金森病。因此，治疗帕金森氏症的药物被添加进来，这就是所谓的“处方级联”。这些反过来又会导致低血压和精神错乱——当然，这些都需要更多的药物来治疗。</p>
<p>The problems compound in other way, too. The more pills someone takes, the more likely it becomes that some of them will interact in harmful ways. Pharmacists have reference databases which they check for nasty drug interactions. But knowledge is limited because clinical trials tend to test only one drug at a time. Pharmacists cannot catch problematic combinations when different prescriptions are dispensed at different pharmacies. And anything bought over the counter is “completely invisible”, says Dr Steinman.</p>
<p>这些问题还以其他方式复杂化。一个人服用的药片越多，其中一些药物就越有可能产生有害的相互作用。药剂师有参考数据库，他们会检查严重的药物相互作用。但由于临床试验往往一次只测试一种药物，因此知识有限。当不同的药房配发不同的处方时，药剂师无法发现有问题的药物组合。斯坦曼称，任何不用处方的药物都是“完全看不见的”。</p>
<p>All these effects are compounded yet again in the elderly, whose bodies are less efficient at metabolising drugs. Sleeping pills, for example, might make a youngster a bit drowsy the next morning. In an elderly individual they can cause “brain fog” that makes everyday tasks impossible. Getting the dose right is difficult, says Dr Farrell, “because [old people] are usually excluded from clinical trials for new drugs”.</p>
<p>所有这些影响在老年人身上再次加剧，他们的身体代谢药物的效率较低。例如，安眠药可能会让一个孩子第二天早上有点昏昏欲睡。在老年人中，它们会导致“脑雾”，使他们无法完成日常的任务。获得正确的剂量是困难的，法雷尔说，“因为老年人通常被排除在新药的临床试验之外”。</p>
<p>Medication overload persists for several reasons. One, particularly in America, is advertising, which oversells the benefits of medicines, says Dr Farrell. Lack of unified personal health records is another. A cardiologist may prescribe drugs for a patient without knowing what the doctor treating his lungs may have put him on.</p>
<p>药物过量的持续存在有几个原因。其中之一是广告（尤其是在美国），广告过分夸大了药品的好处，法雷尔称。另一个原因是缺乏统一的个人健康记录。心脏病专家可能在不知道治疗他肺部疾病的医生给他开了什么药的情况下给病人开了药。 </p>
<p>Perhaps the most common reason is that patients are not told when to stop taking a drug, or forget. In America one in five patients who are given gabapentin, a potent painkiller, after surgery are still taking it 90 days later (the recommended maximum is four weeks). Often prescriptions are renewed automatically by other doctors, who see them on a patient’s notes and assume they have to be continued.</p>
<p>也许最常见的原因是患者没有被告知何时停止服药，或者忘记服药。在美国，五分之一的病人在手术后服用加巴喷丁(一种强效止痛药)，90天后仍在服用(推荐的最长服用时间是四周)。通常情况下，其他医生在看到病人的病历后，会自动更新处方，并认为必须继续用药。</p>
<p>Many doctors presume that, in any case, patients are not particularly interested in stopping their medicines. That is probably wrong: studies from a number of countries show that eight out of ten patients are willing to give up a drug if their doctor advises them to do so. But those doctors face problems of their own. Money for de-prescribing studies is scant. Drug firms, the main sponsors of clinical trials, are not interested, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>许多医生认为，在任何情况下，病人都不会对停药特别感兴趣。这可能是错误的:来自许多国家的研究表明，如果医生建议，十分之八的患者愿意放弃某种药物。但这些医生也面临着自己的问题。用于减少处方的研究资金很少。作为临床试验的主要赞助者的制药公司对此不感兴趣，原因显而易见。 </p>
<p>Evidence about how to proceed is nevertheless starting to build up. Brochures have been developed in Canada to help patients wean themselves off a number of common drugs. They explain, among other things, what alternatives are available—such as cognitive behavioural therapy rather than sleeping pills for insomnia. Trials suggest they work. </p>
<p>然而，有关如何继续进行的证据正在开始积累。加拿大已经开发了一些小册子来帮助病人戒掉一些常见的药物。除此之外，他们还解释了有哪些可行的替代方案——比如用认知行为疗法而不是安眠药来治疗失眠。试验表明它们是有效的。</p>
<p>Automated de-prescribing tools and guidelines for some medicines have also been developed in recent years. Medsafer, one such electronic tool, increased the share of hospital patients for whom drugs were de-prescribed from 30% to 55%, according to a study published earlier this year in <em>jama Internal Medicine</em>. The Drug Burden Index, another tool, tallies the cumulative doses of drugs with anticholinergic or sedative effects.</p>
<p>近年来还开发了一些药物的自动取消处方工具和指南。今年早些时候发表在《jama Internal Medicine》上的一项研究显示，Medsafer就是这样一种电子工具，它将住院患者中去处方药物的比例从30%提高到了55%。Drug Burden Index是另一个工具，它能统计抗胆碱能或镇静作用的药物的累积剂量。  </p>
<p>A medical movement, in other words, is beginning. Its potential impact could be considerable. Keith Ridge, England’s chief pharmaceutical officer, drew an ironic but telling comparison in 2021: “With well over a billion items dispensed each year”, he wrote, “there is a huge prize to be gained in improving the health of millions of people—comparable to a new ‘blockbuster’ medicine—if we can only get this right.” ■ </p>
<p>换句话说，一场医学运动正在开始。它的潜在影响可能相当大。英国首席制药官基思·里奇在2021年做了一个具有讽刺意味但很有说服力的比较:“每年分发的药品远远超过10亿件，”他写道，“如果我们能做到这一点，就能在改善数百万人的健康方面获得巨大的回报，这可以与一种新的‘重磅’药物相媲美。”■</p>

REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis"></p>
<p>Apr 20th 2023</p>
<p>The intricate timber roof-tiles were assembled in Delhi, the bright stone walls sourced from Rajasthan. But the man who opened the door of Apple’s gleaming new Mumbai outlet on April 18th had been flown in from California. Tim Cook, Apple’s boss, dispensed high-fives and <em>namastes</em> as he opened that shop and, two days later, an equally ritzy outlet in Delhi, the first Apple stores in India.</p>
<p>Soon to become the world’s most populous country, India has a new strategic importance for the world’s most valuable firm. As the crowds at Apple’s stores demonstrated, India is a growing consumer of pricey tech gadgetry. And as the humming factories outside Chennai show, the country is also increasingly a maker of them. With political and logistical difficulties mounting in China, Apple is putting down roots in a new Asian market.</p>
<p>Take consumers first. India will shortly have more of them than any country, as its population of 1.4bn edges past that of China this year. Apple products are beyond the means of most Indians. Whereas Apple accounts for more than half the phones sold in America, its market share in India last year was 4.5%, according to Counterpoint, a research firm. But as they get richer, Indians are upgrading their handsets. In the year to March, Apple’s revenues in India were almost $6bn, an increase of nearly 50% on a year earlier, according to Bloomberg. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, an investment firm, forecasts that its Indian revenues could reach $20bn in 2025. “India is a hugely exciting market for us,” Mr Cook told investors in February. “We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago…and bringing that to bear.”</p>
<p>That applies to manufacturing processes, too. In the first two decades of the century Apple shifted most of its manufacturing to China. But China is becoming a riskier place for American firms to do business. One danger is political, as the two countries vie for tech supremacy. America’s threat to ban TikTok, a popular Chinese-owned social-media app, could be met by equivalent sanctions on American firms. Another risk is logistical. China’s zero-covid policy has interrupted manufacturing supply chains, most recently in November and December, when a series of hiccups hampered production of the iPhone 14 Pro. </p>
<p>Given these risks, the company is scrambling to avoid having all its apples in one basket. India, where Apple began manufacturing with the domestic market in mind, is now seen as a future export base. Government subsidies help. In September Apple announced that it was making the iPhone 14 in India, the first time it had assembled a latest-generation phone in the country. By 2025 a quarter of iPhones will be made outside China, mainly in India, forecasts JPMorgan Chase, a bank. Vietnam, where Apple is reckoned to make almost half its AirPod earphones, has been another winner. Apple is now in talks to make its MacBook laptops in Thailand, <em>Nikkei</em> reported earlier this month.</p>
<p>Apple plays down the idea that it is deserting China; even in a worst-case scenario it would keep manufacturing there for China’s vast domestic market (worth more than $70bn to Apple last year) and for some export, insiders say. Last month Mr Cook visited Beijing, where he hailed the “symbiotic” relationship between Apple and China and was applauded as he toured the company’s flagship store in the capital.</p>
<p>He has little choice but to maintain friendly relations. Even as Apple shifts some final assembly of its products to other countries, it relies on its long Chinese supply chains for components. Making tech gadgetry is a capital-intensive business. No country will have a manufacturing ecosystem like China’s any time soon, says Anshul Gupta of Gartner, a research firm: “There will always be some interdependence across these markets. You cannot just be completely decoupled.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, India and others are eager to take whatever slice they can of Apple’s manufacturing pie. On April 19th Mr Cook was entertained in Delhi by Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister. A noted selfie-enthusiast, Mr Modi has been spotted wielding a gold iPhone. Judging by the crowds at Apple’s new stores, he soon won’t be the only one.■</p>

<p>![image-20230426093631328](&#x2F;Users&#x2F;chenyujie&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;typora-user-images&#x2F;image-20230426093631328.png)</p>
<p>The american presidential election of 2024 will feature Joe Biden against the Republican nominee. The polls suggest that person will be Donald Trump. Mr Biden announced his re-election bid on April 25th, the four-year anniversary of the start of his previous presidential campaign. Though in fact this will be the fourth time Mr Biden has run for president: his first attempt came before the fall of the Soviet Union or, for those who think in terms of Michael Jackson’s discography, between “Bad” and “Dangerous”. Were he to win and complete a second term, he would be 86 when he left office. America’s population is much younger than that of other Western democracies, its economy more vibrant. Its politics, however, are gerontocratic.</p>
<p>Those two facts—Mr Biden’s familiarity and his age—help explain why 70% of Americans do not want him to run again, a number that includes 50% of Democrats. Were he an inspiring campaigner, the span between his first presidential bid and his first successful one might not have been 32 years. In 2020 Mr Biden’s candidacy was the answer to a problem the Democratic Party had created for itself. The front-runner in the primaries, Bernie Sanders, would have been a huge risk for the party to take, given his hard-left policies and the substantial risk that he would have lost to President Trump. Who among the field had the greatest chance of holding off Mr Sanders and then beating Mr Trump? It was the guy who had always been there, the man whose appeal was that, in a time of too much political excitement, he was a bit dull.</p>
<p>Four years on, the Democratic Party is stuck with a similar dilemma. Incumbent presidents always run again if they think they will win their primary. The Democratic Party has plenty of talent: Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, Raphael Warnock, a senator from Georgia, Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky, to name a few, have all shown the ability to win in places where Republicans are competitive. But Democrats are a more orderly bunch than Republicans these days. No serious candidates wish to destabilise a sitting president’s campaign. And so Mr Biden’s only primary challengers so far are a former spiritual adviser to Oprah Winfrey and an anti-vaccine campaigner. If the field stays like that, there may be no Democratic primary debates next year at all.</p>
<p>And yet this is not as sorry a position as it might seem. Yes, most Americans do not want Mr Biden to run again. But reluctant Democrats will line up behind their nominee. And, more importantly, an even higher number do not want another four years of Mr Trump. Among voters in general, Mr Biden’s numbers (minus ten points if you subtract those who feel negatively about him from those who feel positive) beat Mr Trump’s (minus 19). Nor is Mr Biden’s approval rating as bad as it seems if the point of comparison is not just past American presidents but the current presidents and prime ministers of other rich countries. Western voters are hard to lead in the 2020s: Justin Trudeau in Canada, Rishi Sunak in Britain and Emmanuel Macron in France all have even lower approval ratings than Mr Biden (see chart).</p>
<p>![image-20230426093747189](&#x2F;Users&#x2F;chenyujie&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;typora-user-images&#x2F;image-20230426093747189.png)</p>
<p>In theory, sitting presidents run on their records. Were that the case, Mr Biden could feel more confident ahead of next year’s vote. He has done more than almost anyone to prevent Russia from taking over Ukraine, without deploying any American troops. At home his big idea has been to pursue an industrial policy aimed at increasing the domestic manufacture of semiconductor chips, thereby easing American dependence on Taiwan, and to hand out subsidies aimed at speeding up the decarbonisation of America’s economy. This may be unwelcome to free-traders (and to some allies), but it goes with the mood of a country that has profited richly from globalisation while remaining convinced that it is under threat from foreign trade. As president, Mr Biden’s boast that he could make deals with the Senate that others could not—because he had spent 36 years working there—turned out to be true.</p>
<p>In practice, though, elections are not just referendums on the achievements of the incumbent. Campaigning matters. And Mr Biden is not very good at it. The video announcing his 2024 run was an admission of that: the president is better when chopped into small clips, set against a stirring soundtrack with images of happy Americans, than he is giving a speech in front of a crowd. His vice-president, whose autocue sometimes seems to be controlled by Armando Iannucci, is not much help either. Voters seem uncomfortably aware that, should Mr Biden die in office, the burden of command will pass to someone who seems unprepared for it. </p>
<p>In 2020 Mr Biden hardly had to campaign because big gatherings of people were prevented by the spread of covid-19. That suited him, as did the economic slowdown brought about by the pandemic. What will matter even more in 2024 is the performance of the economy. Incumbent presidents running with a strong economy almost always win. Which is another way of saying that a Biden-Trump rematch would be much more uncertain than it should be, relying on factors beyond Mr Biden’s control. If Mr Trump is indeed the nominee, he promises a revenge presidency (“I am your retribution,” he declared to fans at a recent conservative conference); and his second White House will be staffed with true believers. The task of preventing that would once again fall on Mr Biden’s octogenarian shoulders. Every stumble he makes over the next year and a half will be a reminder of that burden.■</p>

<p>Apr 20th 2023 | SINGAPORE</p>
<p>Drive through any city in South-East Asia and Japan’s commercial presence is visible everywhere: vehicles made by Toyota, Honda and Nissan <strong>clog the roads</strong>, the result of decades of market dominance in the region. If Fast Retailing, the parent company behind Uniqlo, a clothing retailer, has its way, the drivers of those vehicles will soon be wearing Japanese clothes, too.</p>
<p>开车穿过东南亚的任何一个城市，到处都能看到日本的商业存在:丰田、本田和日产制造的汽车堵塞了道路，这是数十年来在该地区占据市场主导地位的结果。如果服装零售商优衣库的母公司迅销公司能够如愿以偿，这些汽车的司机很快也将穿上日本服装。</p>
<p>The company’s latest results were a boon for shareholders, with operating profits of ¥103bn ($760m) in the three months to the end of February, <strong>up by 48% compared with the same period last year.</strong> They already had good reason for cheer: the company’s shares have risen by 53% in the past 12 months, making it one of the best-performing large listed companies in Japan. Its shares are now just <strong>10% shy of their all-time highs in February 2021</strong>, and, with a market capitalisation of $76bn, it is the country’s sixth-largest listed firm.</p>
<p>该公司的最新业绩对股东来说是一个福音，截至2月底的三个月营业利润为1030亿日元(7.6亿美元)，与去年同期相比增长了48%。他们已经有充分的理由欢呼：该公司的股票在过去12个月里上涨了53%，使其成为日本表现最好的大型上市公司之一。其股价目前仅比2021年2月的历史高点低10%，其市值为760亿美元，是日本第六大上市公司。</p>
<p>At first glance, Uniqlo is an unusual story of a Japanese retailer succeeding overseas. Fast Retailing’s main international competitors—Hennes &amp; Mauritz ab, the parent company of h&amp;m, and Inditex, the parent of Zara—are based in Sweden and Spain respectively. But the firm’s growth abroad follows as much in the footsteps of Japan’s industrial and manufacturing firms as its European peers.</p>
<p>乍一看，优衣库是日本零售商在海外取得成功的一个不同寻常的故事。迅销的主要国际竞争对手——H&amp;M的母公司Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB和Zara的母公司Inditex——分别位于瑞典和西班牙。但是该公司在海外的发展跟随着日本工业和制造业公司和欧洲同行的脚步。</p>
<p>Japanese industrial firms, carmakers in particular, made South-East Asia a second home from the 1960s onwards. Fast Retailing is also expanding particularly rapidly in Asia, where sales (excluding its home market and greater China) are <strong>up by 71% in the six months to the end of February</strong>, <strong>compared with the same period a year ago</strong>. The region now accounts for 16% of sales, up from 11% a year ago, and it is closing in on China, which dropped from 25% to 22% over the same period. In the 1960s the focus of Japanese firms was on exploration for oil, the supply of natural resources and producing industrial goods in countries with import-substitution policies. Now the region represents a promising market for Uniqlo rather than somewhere to put factories.</p>
<p>日本的工业公司，尤其是汽车制造商，从20世纪60年代起就把东南亚作为他们的第二故乡。迅销在亚洲的扩张速度也特别快，在截至2月底的6个月里，亚洲的销售额(不包括本土市场和大中华区)与去年同期相比增长了71%。该地区目前占该公司销售额的16%，高于一年前的11%，并正在接近中国的销售额，后者同期的占比从25%降至22%。20世纪60年代，日本公司的重点是在实行进口替代政策的国家勘探石油、供应自然资源和生产工业产品。现在，该地区对优衣库来说是一个充满希望的市场，而不是一个建厂的地方。</p>
<p>The comparison extends beyond geography. <strong>Exposed to demographic constraints</strong> in fast-ageing Japan, Fast Retailing has used technology and automation to replace workers, further mimicking the country’s large manufacturers. Keyence, a largely unheralded giant of industrial automation, is Japan’s second-largest listed firm, worth $111bn. Since 2017 Uniqlo has embedded all its garments with tiny identification tags, which enable automatic scanning at checkouts.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">【1】unheralded 未事先宣布的</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>这种比较超越了地理位置。在快速老龄化的日本，迅销受到人口限制的影响，利用技术和自动化来代替员工，进一步模仿日本的大型制造商。Keyence是一家默默无闻的工业自动化巨头，是日本第二大上市公司，市值1110亿美元。自2017年以来，优衣库在所有服装上都嵌入了微小的识别标签，可以在结账时自动扫描。</p>
<p>The reliance on automation goes deep into the company’s business operations and supply chain, too. In 2019 it joined up with Japan’s Mujin and France’s Exotec Solutions, both small robotics companies, with the aim of automating the jobs in its warehouses. It had already joined forces in 2018 with Daifuku, a larger automation firm, which helped reduce the workforce at a warehouse in Tokyo by 90%.</p>
<p>对自动化的依赖也深入到公司的业务运营和供应链中。2019年，该公司与日本的Mujin和法国的Exotec Solutions这两家小型机器人公司合作，目的是实现仓库工作的自动化。2018年，该公司已经与更大的自动化公司Daifuku合作，帮助东京一家仓库减少了90%的劳动力。</p>
<p>The savings are no longer just a bonus for the firm’s bottom line. Uniqlo raised salaries for some employees by up to 40% in March, in an effort to make corporate wages comparable to similar firms internationally, in order to compete for talent, and will set pay based on global standards in future. Savings from automation will be a necessity if the company wants to avoid eating into its profit margins to bump up salaries for its staff. ■</p>
<p>节省下来的钱不再仅仅是公司盈利的奖金。今年3月，优衣库将部分员工的工资上调了40%，以使公司工资与国际上的同类公司相媲美，以争夺人才，并将在未来根据全球标准制定薪酬。如果该公司想要避免为了提高员工工资而蚕食其利润率，那么自动化带来的节省将是必要的。■</p>

<p>Apr 23rd 2023</p>
<p>A fascinating case study on the exercise of power within an organisation has just <strong>reached a conclusion</strong> in Britain. Dominic Raab resigned as the country’s deputy prime minister and justice secretary on April 21st, after an independent investigation into whether he is a workplace bully found that he had <strong>crossed a line</strong>. The civil servants who lodged complaints against him will feel justified. His supporters, and the man himself, contend that his departure sets an unhealthily low bar for being found guilty of bullying.</p>
<p>在英国，一个关于组织内部权力行使的有趣案例研究刚刚得出结论。多米尼克·拉布于4月21日辞去了副首相兼司法部长的职务，此前一项关于他是否职场霸凌的独立调查发现，他做得过分了。那些对他提出投诉的公务员会觉得自己是有道理的。他的支持者和他本人都认为，他的离开为欺凌行为设定了一个不好的“低”门槛。 </p>
<p>Adam Tolley, the barrister <u>who conducted the probe</u>, found that Mr Raab had displayed “unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct” while he held the job of foreign secretary. Mr Tolley also concluded that Mr Raab’s style at the ministry of justice was sometimes “intimidating” and “insulting”. Mr Raab may not have intended to upset but that is not enough to <strong><u><em>get him off the hook</em></u></strong>: the British government’s own website says that bullying is “behaviour that makes someone feel intimidated or offended”. </p>
<p>进行调查的律师亚当•托利发现，拉布在担任外交大臣期间表现出“不合理且持续的攻击性行为”。托利还总结道，拉布在司法部的风格有时是“恐吓”和“侮辱”的。拉布可能无意冒犯，但这不足以让他摆脱责任：英国政府自己的网站称，欺凌是“让人感到被恐吓或被冒犯的行为”。</p>
<p>The context of the Raab affair is unusual. Media interest is high, and the relationship between civil servants and British government ministers is a very particular one. But the question of what distinguishes someone who merely sets high standards, which is Mr Raab’s version of events, from someone who is a bully is of interest in workplaces everywhere. In a survey published in 2021 around 30% of American workers, for example, said they had direct experience of abusive conduct at work; in two-thirds of cases, the bully was someone above them in the food chain. </p>
<p>拉布事件的背景不同寻常。媒体的兴趣很高，公务员和英国政府部长之间的关系是非常特殊。但是，如何区分一个仅仅设定高标准的人(这是拉布对事件的描述)和一个恃强凌弱的人，这个问题在所有工作场所都引起了人们的兴趣。例如，在2021年发布的一项调查中，约30%的美国员工表示，他们在工作中直接经历过“虐待”行为；在三分之二的案例中，欺凌他们的人是在食物链中地位高于他们的人。</p>
<p>It is hard to read the report and not feel an unexpected twinge of sympathy for Mr Raab. Unfashionable though it is to admit it, fear is a part of organisational life. Hierarchies hand managers the power and remit to weed out poor performers. Driven, demanding types are often the people who make it up the ladder. </p>
<p>读到这份报告，你很难不对拉布产生一种意想不到的同情。尽管承认这一点不合时宜，但恐惧是组织生活的一部分。等级制度赋予管理者淘汰表现不佳者的权力和职责。上进心强、要求高的人往往是能爬上阶梯的人。</p>
<p>Mr Raab is definitely that. Mr Tolley describes an exacting boss: hard-working, impatient and direct. He interrupts when he is not getting a straight answer. He does not want to spend time rehearsing arguments that have already been aired. If he thinks work <strong>falls short of</strong> the required standard, he says so. </p>
<p>拉布先生绝对是这样。托利描述了一位苛刻的老板: 工作勤奋、不耐烦、直接。得不到直接回答时，他就会打断。他不想把时间花在重复已经被表达过的论点上。如果他认为工作没有达到要求的标准，他就会说出来。</p>
<p>Mr Raab shares many of the attributes of a desk light: he is bright, glares a lot and is not known for empathy. But he appears to be motivated principally by achieving better outcomes. The investigation found no evidence that Mr Raab shouted or swore at people, or that he targeted individual civil servants. Mr Tolley was unpersuaded by allegations from officials that he made threatening physical gestures, whether banging the table loudly or putting his hand out towards someone’s face to stop them talking. The “hand out” gesture was not as emphatic as alleged, writes the lawyer; the banging was unlikely “to cause alarm”. If Mr Raab is a bully, he is not nearly as aggressive as some media reporting had implied.</p>
<p>拉布有许多台灯的特点: 他很聪明，经常瞪着眼睛，而且不善于换位思考。但他的动机似乎主要是为了取得更好的结果。调查没有发现拉布对人大喊大叫或咒骂的证据，也没有发现他针对个别公务员的证据。托利不相信官员们的指控，称他做出了威胁的肢体动作，比如大声敲桌子，或者把手伸到别人脸上阻止他们说话。律师写道，“伸手”的手势并不像声称的那样坚定; 敲桌子的声音不太可能“引起惊慌”。如果拉布是一个恃强凌弱的人，那么他并不像一些媒体报道所暗示的那样咄咄逼人。</p>
<p>Yet that twinge of sympathy passes, as twinges are wont to do. The number and consistency of complaints about Mr Raab is itself evidence that something was genuinely amiss. The civil servants who <strong>spoke out about</strong> him had worked for other ministers before; they were not greenhorns. Mr Tolley is persuaded that the complainants acted in good faith, despite protests from Mr Raab that he is the victim of “activist civil servants”. </p>
<p>然而，那种一瞬间同情飞快就没了，就像阵痛通常会发生的那样。针对拉布先生的投诉数量之多和持续不断，本身就证明确实出了问题。揭发他的公务员以前曾为其他部长工作过；他们不是新来的。托利先生相信，尽管拉布先生抗议说他是“激进公务员”的受害者，但是申诉人的行为是出于善意。</p>
<p>Mr Tolley’s most acute observation is to recognise that working life is not a series of discrete incidents, each bearing no relation to the other. Some of the complaints people had about Mr Raab might seem innocuous in isolation. A propensity to bang the table or interrupt people is discourteous but plenty of bosses do the same. Cutting people off in meetings would have mattered less if he was not also the sort of person to describe work he received as “utterly useless” and “woeful”. Bullying can be a one-off, but more often it is incremental: stresses accumulate, anxiety builds, atmospheres form. </p>
<p>托利最敏锐的观察是认识到，工作生活不是一系列互不相关的事件，彼此之间没有任何关系。人们对拉布先生的一些抱怨单独来看可能是无害的。喜欢拍桌子或打断别人说话是不礼貌的，但很多老板也会这样做。如果他不是那种把自己收到的工作描述为“完全无用”和“糟糕透顶”的人，那么在会议上打断别人的发言就不会那么重要了。欺凌可能是一次性的，但更多时候是渐进式的: 压力累积，焦虑积累，氛围形成。</p>
<p>And even if you think Mr Raab has been unfairly labelled as a bully, it is hard to overlook another problem—his effectiveness as a manager. If enough people think you are a bad boss, you are a bad boss. If employees try to avoid you, the pool of talent available to you shrinks. Mr Tolley himself, who has done a scrupulously fair job, clearly found the deputy prime minister trying. He describes Mr Raab’s approach to the investigation as “somewhat absolutist”. That sounds suspiciously like British-lawyer-speak for “he is a complete nightmare”. ■</p>
<p>即使你认为拉布被贴上了恶霸的标签是不公平的，你也很难忽视另一个问题，他作为管理者给人留下的印象。如果有足够多的人认为你是一个坏老板，那么你就是一个坏老板。如果员工都躲着你，你可用的人才库就会缩水。托利先生本人在工作中一丝不苟地做到了公正，他显然发现副首相在努力。他形容拉布的调查方式“有些绝对化”。这听起来很像英国律师所说的“他是个彻头彻尾的噩梦”的描述。■</p>

<p>Apr 20th 2023</p>
<p>“Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart…and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilisation?” These questions were asked last month in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute, an ngo. It called for a six-month “pause” in the creation of the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence (AI), and was signed by tech luminaries including Elon Musk. It is the most prominent example yet of how rapid progress in AI has sparked anxiety about the potential dangers of the technology.</p>
<p>“我们应该把所有的工作都自动化吗，包括那些令人满意的工作? 我们是否应该发展非人类的思想，最终超过我们，智胜我们… 并取代我们？我们应该冒着失去对文明控制的风险吗？”上个月，非政府组织生命未来研究所在一封公开信中提出了这些问题。它呼吁在创造最先进的人工智能方面“暂停”六个月，并得到了包括埃隆·马斯克在内的科技名人签名。这是迄今为止最突出的例子，说明人工智能的快速发展引发了人们对该技术潜在危险的担忧。</p>
<p>In particular, new “large language models” (LLMs)—the sort that powers ChatGPT, a chatbot made by OpenAI, a startup—have surprised even their creators with their unexpected talents as they have been scaled up. Such “emergent” abilities include everything from solving logic puzzles and writing computer code to identifying films from plot summaries written in emoji. </p>
<p>特别是，新的“大语言模型”(LLM)——给初创公司OpenAI制造的聊天机器人ChatGPT赋能的模型——随着规模的扩大，它们出人意料的才能甚至让创造者感到惊讶。这种“涌现”能力包括从解决逻辑难题、编写计算机代码，以及从emoji写的情节摘要中猜电影等各种能力。</p>
<p>These models stand to transform humans’ relationship with computers, knowledge and even with themselves. Proponents of AI argue for its potential to solve big problems by developing new drugs, designing new materials to help fight climate change, or untangling the complexities of fusion power. To others, the fact <u>that ais’ capabilities are already outrunning their creators’ understanding</u> risks bringing to life the science-fiction disaster scenario <u>of the machine that outsmarts its inventor</u>, often with fatal consequences.</p>
<p>这些模型将改变人类与计算机、知识甚至与自己的关系。人工智能的支持者认为，它有潜力通过开发新药、设计新材料以应对气候变化，或解开核聚变的复杂性，来解决重大问题。对另一些人来说，人工智能的能力已经超出了它们的创造者的理解，这一事实可能会让科幻小说中的灾难场景变成现实，即机器比发明者更聪明，这往往会带来致命的后果。</p>
<p>This bubbling mixture of excitement and fear makes it hard to <strong>weigh the opportunities and risks</strong>. But lessons can be learned from other industries, and from past technological shifts. So what has changed to make AI so much more capable? How scared should you be? And what should governments do?</p>
<p>这种混杂着兴奋和恐惧的情绪让人很难权衡机会和风险。但可以从其他行业和过去的技术变革中吸取教训。那么，是什么变化让人工智能变得如此强大呢？你应该有多害怕？政府应该怎么做?</p>
<p>In a special Science section, we explore the workings of llms and their future direction. The first wave of modern AI systems, which emerged a decade ago, relied on carefully labelled training data. Once exposed to a sufficient number of labelled examples, they could learn to do things like recognise images or transcribe speech. Today’s systems do not require pre-labelling, and as a result can be trained using much larger data sets taken from online sources. LLMs can, in effect, be trained on the entire internet—which explains their capabilities, good and bad.</p>
<p>在科学专栏中，我们探讨了LLM的工作原理及其未来发展方向。10年前出现的第一波现代人工智能系统依赖于精心标记的训练数据。一旦接触到足够数量的有标签的例子，他们就能学会做一些事情，比如识别图像或转写语音。今天的系统不需要预先标记，因此可以使用从网上获取的更大的数据集进行训练。实际上，LLM可以将整个互联网上的数据用于训练——这就解释了他们的能力，无论好坏。</p>
<p>Those capabilities became apparent to a wider public when ChatGPT was released in November. A million people had used it within a week; 100m within two months. It was soon being used to generate school essays and wedding speeches. ChatGPT’s popularity, and Microsoft’s move to incorporate it into Bing, its search engine, prompted rival firms to release chatbots too. </p>
<p>当ChatGPT于11月发布时，这些功能对更广泛的公众来说是显而易见的。一周内就有100万人使用了它; 两个月内达到1亿人使用。很快，它就被用来撰写学校论文和婚礼致辞。ChatGPT的流行，以及微软将其整合到必应搜索引擎的举动，促使竞争对手公司也发布了聊天机器人。</p>
<p>Some of these produced strange results. Bing Chat suggested to a journalist that he should leave his wife. ChatGPT has been accused of defamation by a law professor. LLMs produce answers that have the patina of truth, but often contain <strong>factual errors</strong> or <strong>outright fabrications</strong>. Even so, Microsoft, Google and other tech firms have begun to incorporate LLMs into their products, to help users create documents and perform other tasks. </p>
<p>其中一些机器人生成了奇怪的结果。Bing Chat建议一位记者离开他的妻子。ChatGPT被一位法学教授指控诽谤。LLM提供的答案看似是事实，但其往往包含事实错误或彻头彻尾的捏造。即便如此，微软、谷歌和其他科技公司已经开始将LLM整合到他们的产品中，以帮助用户创建文档以及执行其他任务。</p>
<p>The recent acceleration in both the power and visibility of AI systems, and <strong><u>growing awareness</u></strong> of their abilities and defects, have raised fears that the technology is now advancing so quickly that it cannot be safely controlled. Hence the call for a pause, and <strong><u>growing concern</u></strong> that AI could threaten not just jobs, factual accuracy and reputations, but the existence of humanity itself. </p>
<p>最近人工智能系统的功能和关注度都在加速发展，人们对其能力和缺陷的认识也在不断提高，这让人们担心，这项技术现在发展得如此之快，以至于无法对其进行安全控制。因此，人们呼吁暂停，越来越多的人担心人工智能不仅会威胁到就业、事实准确性和声誉，还会威胁到人类本身的存在。</p>
<h2 id="Extinction-Rebellion"><a href="#Extinction-Rebellion" class="headerlink" title="Extinction? Rebellion?"></a>Extinction? Rebellion?</h2><p>The fear that machines will steal jobs is centuries old. But so far new technology has created new jobs to replace the ones it has destroyed. Machines tend to be able to perform some tasks, not others, increasing demand for people who can do the jobs machines cannot. <strong>Could this time be different?</strong> A sudden dislocation in job markets cannot be ruled out, even if so far there is no sign of one. Previous technology has tended to replace unskilled tasks, but LLMs can perform some white-collar tasks, such as summarising documents and writing code.</p>
<p>对于机器会抢走工作的担忧已经存在了几个世纪。但到目前为止，新技术创造了新的工作岗位，以取代了被它摧毁的工作岗位。机器往往能完成某些任务，而不能完成其他任务，这就增加了对能做机器不能做的工作的人的需求。这一次会有所不同吗？不能排除就业市场突然出现混乱的可能性，即使到目前为止还没有出现这种迹象。以前的技术倾向于取代非技术性的任务，但LLM可以执行一些白领任务，如总结文档以及编写代码。</p>
<p>The degree of existential risk posed by AI <strong><u>has been hotly debated</u></strong>. Experts are <strong><u>divided</u></strong>. In a survey of AI researchers carried out in 2022, 48% thought there was at least a 10% chance that AI’s impact would be “extremely bad (eg, human extinction)”. But 25% said the risk was 0%; the median researcher put the risk at 5%. The nightmare is that an advanced AI causes harm on a massive scale, by making poisons or viruses, or persuading humans to commit terrorist acts. It need not have evil intent: researchers worry that future AIs may have goals that do not align with those of their human creators.</p>
<p>人工智能带来的生存风险程度一直备受争议。专家们对此意见不一。在2022年对人工智能研究人员进行的一项调查中，48%的人认为人工智能的影响“极其糟糕(例如人类灭绝)”的可能性至少有10%。但25%的人认为风险为0; 中位数的研究人员给出的风险为5%。可怕的是，先进的人工智能制造毒药或病毒，或说服人类进行恐怖活动，造成大规模的伤害。它不一定有邪恶的意图: 研究人员担心未来的人工智能可能会有与人类创造者不一致的目标。</p>
<p>Such scenarios should not be dismissed. But all involve a huge amount of guesswork, and a leap from today’s technology. And many imagine that future AIs will have unfettered access to energy, money and computing power, which are real constraints today, and could be denied to a rogue AI in future. Moreover, experts tend to overstate the risks in their area, compared with other forecasters. (And Mr Musk, who is launching his own AI startup, has an interest in his rivals downing tools.) Imposing heavy regulation, or indeed a pause, today seems an over-reaction. A pause would also be unenforceable. </p>
<p>这种情况不应被忽视。但所有这些都涉及到大量的猜测，以及与当今技术相比的飞跃。许多人想象，未来的人工智能将不受限制地获得能源、金钱和计算能力，这些在今天是真正的限制，在未来可能会被一个流氓人工智能所拒绝。此外，与其他预测者相比，专家们往往倾向于夸大他们所在领域的风险。(马斯克正在创办自己的人工智能初创公司，他对竞争对手研发工具很感兴趣。)实施严格的监管，或者实际上暂停，在今天看来似乎是一种过度反应。暂停也是不可能实施的。</p>
<p>Regulation is needed, but for more mundane reasons than saving humanity. Existing AI systems raise real concerns about bias, privacy and intellectual-property rights. As the technology advances, other problems could become apparent. The key is to balance the promise of AI with an assessment of the risks, and to be ready to adapt. </p>
<p>监管是必要的，但是出于更世俗的原因，而非拯救人类。现有的人工智能系统引发了对偏见、隐私和知识产权的真正担忧。随着技术的进步，其他问题可能会变得明显。关键是要平衡人工智能的前景与风险评估，并做好适应的准备。</p>
<p>So far governments are taking three different approaches. At one end of the spectrum is Britain, which has proposed a “light-touch” approach with no new rules or regulatory bodies, but applies existing regulations to AI systems. The aim is to boost investment and turn Britain into an “AI superpower”. America has taken a similar approach, though the Biden administration is now seeking public views on what a rulebook might look like.</p>
<p>到目前为止，政府采取了三种不同的方法。英国处于一个极端，它提出了一种“轻触式”的方法，没有新的规则或监管机构，但将现有法规应用于人工智能系统。其目的是促进投资，使英国成为“人工智能超级大国”。美国也采取了类似的做法，尽管拜登政府现在正在征求公众对规则手册的看法。</p>
<p>The eu is taking a tougher line. Its proposed law categorises different uses of AI by the degree of risk, and requires increasingly stringent monitoring and disclosure as the degree of risk rises from, say, music-recommendation to self-driving cars. Some uses of AI are banned altogether, such as subliminal advertising and remote biometrics. Firms that break the rules will be fined. For some critics, these regulations are too stifling. </p>
<p>欧盟采取了更强硬的立场。它提出的法律根据风险程度对人工智能的不同用途进行分类，并要求随着风险程度的上升，比如从音乐推荐到自动驾驶汽车，越来越严格的监控和披露。人工智能的某些用途是完全被禁止的，比如潜意识广告和远程生物识别。违反规定的公司将被罚款。对于一些批评人士来说，这些规定太令人窒息了。</p>
<p>But others say an even sterner approach is needed. Governments should treat AI like medicines, with a dedicated regulator, strict testing and pre-approval before public release. China is doing some of this, requiring firms to register AI products and undergo a security review before release. a key requirement is that AIs’ output reflects the “core value of socialism”.</p>
<p>但也有人说，需要采取更严厉的措施。政府应该像对待药物一样对待AI，有专门的监管机构，在公开上市之前进行严格的测试和预先批准。中国正在做一些这样的事情，要求公司注册人工智能产品，并在发布前进行安全审查。一个关键的要求是人工智能的输出体现“社会主义的核心价值观”。</p>
<p>What to do? The light-touch approach is unlikely to be enough. If AI is as important a technology as cars, planes and medicines—and there is good reason to believe that it is—then, like them, it will need new rules. Accordingly, the EU’s model is closest to the mark, though its classification system is overwrought and a principles-based approach would be more flexible. Compelling disclosure about how systems are trained, how they operate and how they are monitored, and requiring inspections, would be comparable to similar rules in other industries. </p>
<p>该怎么办？这种轻触式的方法可能不太够。如果人工智能与汽车、飞机和医药一样重要(我们有充分的理由相信这一点)，那么就像它们一样，它需要新的规则。因此，欧盟的模式是最接近目标的，尽管其分类系统过细，基于原则的方法将更加灵活。强制披露系统的训练方式、运行方式以及监控方式，并要求进行检查，这将与其他行业的类似规定相媲美。</p>
<p>This could allow for tighter regulation over time, if needed. A dedicated regulator may then seem appropriate; so too may intergovernmental treaties, similar to those that govern nuclear weapons, should plausible evidence emerge of existential risk. To monitor that risk, governments could form a body modelled on CERN, a particle-physics laboratory, that could also study AI safety and ethics—areas where companies lack incentives to invest as much as society might wish. </p>
<p>随着时间的推移，这将允许更严格的监管（如果需要的话）。一个专门的监管机构似乎是合适的；如果出现存在风险的可信证据，政府间条约(类似于管理核武器的条约)也可能是合适的。为了监控这种风险，政府可以仿照粒子物理实验室欧洲核子研究中心组建一个机构，该机构也可以研究人工智能的安全和伦理——在这些领域，企业缺乏动力，不愿像社会所希望的那样进行投资。</p>
<p>This powerful technology poses new risks, but also offers extraordinary opportunities. Balancing the two means treading carefully. A measured approach today can provide the foundations on which further rules can be added in future. But the time to start building those foundations is now. ■</p>
<p>这项强大的技术带来了新的风险，但也提供了非凡的机遇。平衡两者意味着要谨慎行事。今天慎重的方法可以为将来添加更多规则打下地基。但现在是时候开始建立这些地基了。■</p>

<p>Apr 13th 2023</p>
<p>America’s war on drugs has been a disaster. More than a million Americans have died of overdoses since the government started counting in 1999. No wonder a growing number of states are interested in trying something different. Nine of them are contemplating decriminalising the possession of a small amount of drugs. This newspaper has long championed more liberal laws, but before rushing ahead, reform-minded states—in America and beyond—would do well to consider the experience of Oregon, the only American state so far to enact decriminalisation. It has had a rocky start.</p>
<p>美国的毒品战争是一场灾难。自1999年政府开始统计以来，已有超过100万美国人死于药物过量。难怪越来越多的州有兴趣尝试一些不同的东西。其中9个州正在考虑将持有少量毒品合法化。本刊长期以来一直支持更自由的法律，但在继续推进之前，美国内外那些有改革思想的州最好考虑一下俄勒冈州的经验，俄勒冈州是迄今为止美国唯一一个颁布“毒品”合法化的州。它有一个艰难的开始。</p>
<p>Removing criminal penalties for possessing some drugs makes sense. It can reduce prison numbers and the perils of addiction. Portugal decriminalised the possession of drugs for personal use in 2001. In subsequent years overdose deaths and hiv rates fell, and public drug markets disappeared. </p>
<p>取消对持有某些毒品的刑事处罚是有道理的。它可以减少监狱人数和吸毒的危险。葡萄牙在2001年将私人持有毒品合法化。在随后的几年里，过量服药死亡和艾滋病毒感染率下降，公共毒品市场消失了。</p>
<p>Oregon had hoped for a similar success. In a ballot in 2020, 58% of voters backed decriminalisation. As a result, having a small amount of fentanyl, methamphetamine, heroin or lsd now warrants a punishment <strong>on a par with</strong> a speeding ticket. In the two years since the new law took effect, drug arrests are indeed down. However, overdose deaths in Oregon have risen sharply, far beyond the increase recorded nationally. </p>
<p>俄勒冈州曾希望获得类似的成功。在2020年的投票中，58%的选民支持合法化。因此，现在持有少量芬太尼、甲基苯丙胺、海洛因或麦角酸酰二乙胺的惩罚相当于一张超速罚单。在新法律生效后的两年中，因毒品被捕的人数确实有所下降。然而，俄勒冈州吸毒过量死亡人数急剧上升，远远超过全国记录的增幅。</p>
<p>Under the old scheme, possession charges were a tool to get people into treatment, because punishments could be dropped if offenders agreed to seek help. However, the thinking in Oregon was that treatment was likelier to work better when it was voluntary. The citations for possession that have replaced charges come with a fine of up to $100, which can be waived with a call to a health hotline. The hope was that offenders could then be steered into rehab. But less than 5% of police actions have actually resulted in that phone call.</p>
<p>在旧的方案中，持有毒品的指控是让人们接受治疗的一种手段，因为如果罪犯同意寻求帮助，惩罚就可以取消。然而，俄勒冈州的想法是，如果治疗是自愿的，效果可能会更好。对非法持有毒品的传讯取代了指控，罚款最高可达100美元，而这100美元在拨打健康热线后可免除。这样做的目的是希望罪犯能够被引导到戒毒所。但只有不到5%的警方行动最终导致了这通电话。</p>
<p>Worse, even if people do chose addiction treatment, they may not be able to receive it. Recent analysis found that Oregon state has just half the addiction services it needs. The same ballot measure that decriminalised possession also increased funding for some recovery services, but the money started to flow long after the reform entered into force. Even now, the extra funding will not close the yawning gap in services.</p>
<p>更糟糕的是，即使人们选择了成瘾治疗，他们也可能无法接受治疗。最近的分析发现，俄勒冈州只提供了一半的戒毒服务。将非法持有合法化的投票措施也增加了对一些康复服务的资金，但这些资金在改革生效后很久才开始流动起来。即使是现在，额外的资金也无法弥补服务的巨大鸿沟。</p>
<h2 id="Learn-before-you-leap"><a href="#Learn-before-you-leap" class="headerlink" title="Learn before you leap"></a>Learn before you leap</h2><p>Oregon’s experiment may yet prove a success, but its lessons are clear. First do not rush. The Australian Capital Territory is also in the midst of decriminalising the possession of drugs but, wisely, it is taking a year to prepare and train front-line responders. It is especially important to ensure that treatment is available before moving ahead. The “Field of Dreams” approach to drawing addicts into treatment will not work if you do not actually provide enough places in clinics. And building them is not cheap.</p>
<p>俄勒冈州的实验可能会成功，但它的教训是显而易见的。首先不要冲动。澳大利亚首都领地也在将持有毒品合法化，但明智的是，它花了一年的时间来准备和培训一线应急人员。在继续行动之前，确保治疗是特别重要的。如果你不能在诊所里提供足够的床位，吸引吸毒者接受治疗的“梦幻之地”的方法就不会奏效。而且建造它们并不便宜。</p>
<p>Second, pressure is a necessary part of the policy mix. Many addicts would choose never to walk into a treatment centre. British Columbia, in Canada, is undergoing its own decriminalisation trial and, like Oregon, it has opted not to compel treatment. Yet, with accidental fentanyl overdoses so common, waiting for addicts to <strong>hit rock bottom</strong> can all too easily prove lethal. </p>
<p>其次，（施加）压力是政策组合中不可或缺的一部分。许多吸毒者会选择永远不走进治疗中心。加拿大的不列颠哥伦比亚省正在进行自己的合法化试验，和俄勒冈州一样，它选择不强制治疗。然而，由于意外服用芬太尼过量的普遍性，等待瘾君子跌到谷底很容易被证明是致命的。</p>
<p>It is better to adopt the sort of approach pioneered in Portugal, where people found with drugs have to appear before dissuasion commissions and are shepherded into treatment. The process is laborious, and that alone can discourage casual drug-taking. Italy, which has also decriminalised drug possession, can suspend the driving licences of frequent offenders.</p>
<p>最好采用葡萄牙率先采用的方法，在葡萄牙，被发现吸毒的人必须出现在劝阻委员会面前，并被引导接受治疗。这个过程是费力的，仅凭这一点就可以阻止随意吸毒。意大利也将持有毒品合法化，可以吊销经常违规者的驾驶执照。</p>
<p>Drug epidemics <strong>have no quick fixes.</strong> But the scale of the crisis facing America today is so great that even small improvements are worth striving for. Done correctly, decriminalisation could help people go clean by sparing them the millstone of a criminal record and prevent many deaths from overdoses. That is why it is important to heed the lessons from Oregon. ■</p>
<p>毒品泛滥没有快速解决的办法。但美国今天面临的危机规模如此之大，即使是微小的改善也值得努力。如果处理得当，毒品合法化可以帮助人们摆脱犯罪记录的沉重负担，并防止许多人因吸毒过量而死亡。这就是为什么吸取俄勒冈州的教训很重要。■</p>

<p>Apr 16th 2023</p>
<p>“WHOEVER SAID don’t question things? We say question everything.” So began the television commercial that EY aired in 2021 during the Super Bowl, a sports extravaganza known as much for its pricey ads as for the American football they interrupt. On April 11th, under a little too much questioning from its American branch, the professional-services giant decided to pause indefinitely plans for a separation of its audit and advisory businesses. <strong><u><em>A big sticking point</em></u></strong> was the division of the tax practice, coveted by both the auditors and the advisers. Plans to publicly list the advisory business and load it with debt to pay off audit partners also looked cleverer when the deal was conceived in 2021 amid low interest rates and frothy share prices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>在去年安永内部召开的大会上，全球CEO向超过30万名全球员工宣传咨询拆分为独立公司的好处。安永审计一直坐拥许多世界顶级科技公司：Meta(脸书)、谷歌、亚马逊、甲骨文等。然而安永在科技公司审计市场的地位，既是一种祝福，也是一种诅咒。安永在审计市场的地位，导致公司因利益冲突无法承接大型公司的咨询业务。2001年安然事件后，业界加强了对审计独立性的要求，会计师事务所同时为审计客户提供咨询业务，业界共识会引发利益冲突，进而影响其执业的独立性。</p>
<p>分拆后，审计业务仍是合作伙伴模式，而咨询业务将成为一家上市公司，并将实现更快地扩张。</p>
<p>安永曾计划将其大部分税务业务分拆到一个包含咨询和其他顾问服务的新集团；在分拆后，这家以审计为主的公司只留下少数税务专家。</p>
<p>然而，知情人士表示，<strong>美国的审计师一直在争取在拆分后将更多的税务业务保留在审计部门内</strong>，因为美国对向审计客户提供税务建议的规定比其他国家要宽松一些。如果能争取将更多海外税务业务保留在安永，那他们就能够为美国重要客户的国际子公司服务。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“谁说过不要质疑事物？我们说质疑一切。”安永于2021年在超级碗期间播出的电视广告就是这样开始的。超级碗是一场体育盛会，以昂贵的广告和被它们打断的美式橄榄球而闻名。4月11日，在美国分所的质疑下，这家专业服务巨头决定无限期暂停将审计和咨询业务分离的计划。一个很大的症结在于税务部门的划分，审计员和顾问都觊觎这个业务。在低利率和股价泡沫的情况下，在2021年构思这笔交易时，公开上市咨询业务并让其负债以偿还审计合作伙伴的计划看起来也更明智。</p>
<p>This suspension is a huge blow to EY’s global bosses, who underestimated just what an uphill climb “Project Everest”, the unfortunately codenamed break-up project, would prove. To EY’s split-averse professional-services rivals in the so-called “big four”, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC, it looks like vindication. Joe Ucuzoglu, Deloitte’s global chief, insists the “multidisciplinary model” is the “foundation” of his firm’s success. Bill Thomas, his <strong>opposite number</strong> at KPMG, says his firm’s decision in the early 2000s to list its advisory arm (since regrown) was “not the right thing”. Bob Moritz, who leads PwC, insists keeping the businesses together is central to his firm’s ability to recruit and retain talent. </p>
<p>此次暂停对安永的全球老板们来说是一个巨大的打击，他们低估了“珠穆朗玛峰计划”（不幸的是，这个代号为“分拆”的项目）将会证明什么。对于安永在所谓“四大”中反对分拆的专业服务竞争对手德勤、毕马威和普华永道来说，这似乎证明了其正确性。德勤全球首席执行官乔•乌库佐格鲁坚称，“多学科模式”是德勤成功的“基础”。毕马威的CEO比尔•托马斯表示，毕马威在21世纪初决定将其咨询部门(自重组以来)上市是“不正确的”。普华永道的负责人鲍勃•莫里茨坚持认为，保持业务整合是公司招募和留住人才的关键。</p>
<p>Yet the case against turning the big four into a biggish eight is far from <strong><u><em>open and shut</em></u></strong>. That is because the commercial logic of the split is in many ways getting more compelling—for EY itself, which is still leaving open the possibility of such an outcome one day, and for its three peers. <strong><u><em>At stake</em></u></strong> is the future of one of the business world’s most critical oligopolies.</p>
<p>然而，反对将四大变为八大的理由还远不明晰。这是因为分拆的商业逻辑在很多方面都越来越令人信服——对安永本身和它的三家同行来说，仍有可能在某一天出现这样的结果。这关系到商界最关键寡头之一的未来。</p>

<p>The big four are the heavyweight champions of professional services. They dominate the market for audits—checking the books for 493 of the companies in America’s S&amp;P 500 index and a big proportion of European <strong><u>blue chips</u></strong>. They also offer clients a one-stop shop for advice on issues from dealmaking to digitisation. As of last year they together employed 1.4m people and generated $190bn in fees, up from $134bn in 2017 (see chart 1). KPMG, the smallest of the big four, generates three times the revenue of McKinsey, the high priest of strategy consulting.</p>
<p>四大是专业服务领域的重量级冠军。它们主导着审计市场——为美国标准普尔500指数中的493家公司和欧洲蓝筹股中的一大部分公司进行审计。它们还为客户提供从交易撮合到数字化等问题的一站式咨询服务。截至去年，它们总共雇佣了140万名员工，产生了1900亿美元的费用收入，高于2017年的1340亿美元(见图1)。四大会计师事务所中规模最小的毕马威的收入是战略咨询领域的“大师”麦肯锡的三倍。</p>
<p>The <strong><u>driving force</u></strong> behind the big four’s growth in recent years has been the rapid expansion of their advisory businesses, which now account for half their combined revenues (see chart 2). In the early 2000s EY, KPMG and PwC all spun off or sold their consulting arms in response to new conflict-of-interest regulations, which barred them from selling advice to audit clients. (Deloitte planned but then abandoned a spin-off.) With little room to expand in audits, however, the giants were soon lured back into the fast-growing business of advice.</p>
<p>四大会计师事务所近年来的增长背后的推动力是其咨询业务的快速扩张，目前咨询业务占其总收入的一半(见表2)。在21世纪初，安永、毕马威和普华永道都剥离或出售了咨询业务，以应对新的利益冲突法规，该法规禁止它们向审计客户出售建议。(德勤曾计划分拆，但后来放弃了。)然而，由于审计业务几乎没有扩张空间，这些巨头很快就被吸引回到了快速增长的咨询业务。</p>
<p>The rebundling has in many ways paid off. The opportunity to dabble in different service lines has helped the big four entice the bright-eyed young things their businesses rely on. A career in bean-counting looks more appealing when it comes with the opportunity to work on big acquisitions or advise governments on important matters, observes Laura Empson of Bayes Business School in London and formerly of the board of KPMG’s British branch.</p>
<p>再次捆绑在很多方面都取得了回报。涉足不同服务领域的机会，帮助四大吸引了他们业务所依赖的那些朝气蓬勃的年轻人。伦敦贝叶斯商学院的劳拉•恩普森曾是毕马威英国分公司董事会成员，她认为，当有机会参与大型收购或在重要事务上为政府提供建议时，算账的职业看起来更有吸引力。</p>
<p>The big four’s breadth has helped them win over clients, too. Expertise in areas like tax and valuations have helped KPMG and the others solidify their position as the auditors-of-choice for large companies, says Mr Thomas. Widely recognised audit brands, meanwhile, have given a reputational leg-up to the firms’ advisory arms.</p>
<p>四大的广度也帮助它们赢得了客户。托马斯表示，在税务和估值等领域的专业知识，帮助毕马威和其他会计师事务所巩固了它们作为大公司首选审计机构的地位。与此同时，广受认可的审计品牌为事务所的咨询部门提供了声誉支持。</p>
<p>Mr Moritz argues that the multidisciplinary model has also helped PwC and the other professional-services giants adapt to the digital era. Software and data now underpin nearly all the services the firms offer. The auditors benefit from the technological know-how of the advisors, while the advisors benefit from the counter-cyclical nature of audit work, which can fund investments even during downturns.</p>
<p>莫里茨认为，多学科模式也帮助普华永道和其他专业服务巨头适应数字时代。软件和数据现在几乎支撑着这些公司提供的所有服务。审计师受益于顾问的技术知识，而顾问则受益于审计工作的反周期性质，即使在经济低迷时期也能为投资提供资金。</p>
<p>All that helps explain why some have balked at the idea of a separation. That the firms operate franchise-like structures, with independent partnerships in each country, also makes big shifts in direction like a break up tough to pull off—as EY discovered in America.</p>
<p>所有这些都有助于解释为什么有些人对分拆的想法犹豫不决。这些公司运营着类似特许经营的结构，在每个国家都有独立的合伙人，这也使得方向发生了巨大的转变，就像很难实现的分手——正如安永在美国所发现的那样。</p>
<p>Yet the case for staying conjoined is steadily weakening as the big four’s businesses shift ever more towards consulting. Auditor-independence rules have turned from an inconvenience into a drag; a particular <strong>bugbear</strong> of EY’s is its inability to team up with software firms it audits, like Salesforce, to help them roll out their technology to clients. Newish requirements in Europe and elsewhere for companies to rotate their auditors, typically every ten years, have increased clashes between audit and advisory partners over who will serve big customers. </p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">【1】bugbear 烦恼的根由</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>然而，随着四大的业务越来越多地转向咨询，保持联合的理由正在逐渐减弱。审计独立规则已经从不便变成了拖累; 令安永特别困扰的是，它无法与它审计的软件公司合作，比如Salesforce，从而帮助他们向客户推广他们的技术。欧洲和其他地区对公司审计师轮换的新要求(通常每十年轮换一次)增加了审计和咨询合作伙伴之间关于谁将为大客户服务的冲突。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, audit has been steadily losing its internal clout, says Ms Empson. Sarah Rapson, deputy head of the FRC, Britain’s audit overseer, worries that the firms are no longer fostering the “culture of scepticism and challenge” that auditing relies on.</p>
<p>恩普森女士表示，与此同时，审计部门也在逐渐失去其内部影响力。英国审计监督机构 FRC副主席莎拉•拉普森担心，这些公司不再培养审计所依赖的“怀疑和挑战文化”。</p>
<p>The problems are on display in a string of much publicised audit snafus. On March 31st APAS, Germany’s accounting watchdog, barred EY’s German branch from taking on new publicly listed audit clients for two years over its failure to spot mischief at Wirecard, a fintech darling turned German fraud of the century. Last year KPMG was fined £14m ($18m) by the FRC for feeding misleading information into a review of two of the firm’s audits. In 2020 Deloitte was fined £15m ($19m) by the FRC for audit failings, too.</p>
<p>这些问题表现在一系列被广泛宣传的审计混乱局面中。3月31日，德国会计监管机构APAS禁止安永的德国分公司在两年内接受新的公开上市的审计客户，原因是该公司未能发现Wirecard的欺诈行为。Wirecard是一家金融科技宠儿，后来成为德国的世纪诈骗犯。去年，毕马威被FRC罚款1400万英镑(1800万美元)，原因是在对该公司两份审计报告的审查中提供误导性信息。2020年，德勤也因审计失误被FRC罚款1500万英镑(合1900万美元)。</p>
<p>Those audit flubs have tarnished the consultants by association. They could also lead to greater pressure from regulators to invest more in auditing, particularly around fraud detection. At the same time, the advisers are getting increasingly capital-hungry—they are looking to expand into managed services, running functions like compliance, payroll and cybersecurity on behalf of clients, and need new technology to do it. An advisory spin-off would leave the auditors flush with cash while freeing the consultants to pump themselves up with fresh equity from outside their partnerships. </p>
<p>这些审计上的失误使顾问们的形象受到了牵连。它们还可能导致来自监管机构的更大压力，要求它们加大对审计的投资，尤其是在欺诈检测方面。与此同时，顾问们正变得越来越缺乏资金，他们希望扩展到受控服务领域，代表客户运行合规、薪酬和网络安全等功能，并需要新技术来实现这一点。剥离咨询业务将使审计机构拥有充裕的现金，同时使咨询公司能够从合作伙伴之外获得新的股权。</p>
<p>Staying together may no longer be good for the clients, either. The increasingly specialist skills offered by the big four to their customers leaves fewer opportunities for junior staff to dabble in different tasks. Few chief executives are eager to receive cybersecurity advice from a fresh-faced chartered accountant.</p>
<p>待在一起可能也不再对客户有利了。四大向客户提供的专业技能越来越多，这使得初级员工涉猎不同任务的机会越来越少。很少有首席执行官渴望从一位新面孔的特许会计师那里得到网络安全方面的建议。</p>
<h2 id="You-can-go-your-own-way"><a href="#You-can-go-your-own-way" class="headerlink" title="You can go your own way"></a>You can go your own way</h2><p>Mr Ucuzoglu of Deloitte warns that auditor-advisor break-ups have “never once played out as intended”. True, the consulting business KPMG listed two decades ago, under the name BearingPoint, went bankrupt in 2009. And the sale of EY’s and PwC’s old advisory businesses to, respectively, Capgemini and IBM, two IT-focused consultancies, resulted in their own messy culture clashes.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>毕博咨询公司</strong>（英语：BearingPoint Inc.），前身为毕马威咨询（KPMG Consulting），由毕博欧洲控股公司（英语：BearingPoint Europe Holdings B.V.）旗下所拥有的子公司，著名的管理与技术咨询公司，创立于1997年，总部位于荷兰阿姆斯特丹。<br>它创建于1997年，最早是毕马威会计师事务所之下的独特事业体，提供咨询服务。<br>在2009年宣布破产，被其他公司并购之前，毕博公司是世界上最大的管理与技术咨询公司之一，曾名列全球两百大公司，在超过60个国家拥有分公司。总部位于美国维吉尼亚州麦肯林市（McLean），成员最多时接近17,100名员工。</li>
<li><strong>凯捷管理顾问公司</strong>（英语：Capgemini，Euronext：CAP），总部设于法国巴黎，由法国企业家Serge Kampf于1967年创立，是一间全球性的资讯科技服务管理领导厂商。它列名在巴黎CAC40指数中，是法国前四十大企业。企业总部位于巴黎蒂尔西特路，仍然由Serge Kampf担任首席执行官，目前在全球39个国家拥有分公司，公司雇员共108,698名。前身为安永咨询。它参与创建The Open Group。</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>德勤的乌库佐格鲁先生警告称，审计师和顾问之间的分拆“从未像预期的那样发展”。确实，毕马威20年前以毕博的名义上市的咨询业务于2009年破产。安永和普华永道将原来的咨询业务分别出售给了凯捷和IBM (两家专注于IT的咨询公司)，这导致了它们自身混乱的文化冲突。</p>
<p>As EY reels from its graceless tumble down its Everest, it and its three rivals will certainly <strong>think twice</strong> before embarking on a similar expedition. Still, in the long run the break-up logic is unlikely to go away. Out in the distance they see Accenture, the publicly listed consulting giant that emerged from the rubble of Arthur Andersen, the collapse of which in the early 2000s turned what was the “big five” into the big four. The firm has thrived as a standalone enterprise, now raking in $62bn a year in sales, more than any of the big four. Since listing in 2001 its market value has climbed 20-fold, to $185bn. Such a prize may prove too tantalising to resist. ■</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>安达信会计师事务所（Arthur Andersen）</strong>，总部设于美国芝加哥，曾为全球前五大会计师事务所之一，主要替大公司提供稽核、税务等咨询服务，一度是全球最大之会计师事务所，分拆占大部分营利的安盛咨询（Andersen Consulting）后虽跌至第5，但仍保持当时第6位的均富会计师事务所（Grant Thornton LLP.，中文现称致同会计师事务所）之十倍营业额。2001年1月1日，安盛咨询（Andersen Consulting）更名为埃森哲公司（Accenture），成为全球最大的咨询公司。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>当安永从“珠穆朗玛峰”上摇摇欲坠时，它和它的三个竞争对手在开始类似的探险之前肯定会三思而行。尽管如此，从长远来看，分拆的逻辑不太可能消失。在远处，他们看到了埃森哲，这家从安达信的废墟中崛起的上市咨询巨头。安达信在本世纪初的倒闭，将“五大”变成了“四大”。该公司作为一家独立企业蓬勃发展，现在每年的销售额为620亿美元，超过了四大巨头中的任何一家。自2001年上市以来，该公司市值已攀升20倍，至1850亿美元。事实可能会证明，这样的奖励太过诱人，让人难以抗拒。■</p>

<p>Apr 13th 2023</p>
<p>The pandemic embedded video into the workplace. Workers who had never previously been on camera suddenly spent every hour of the day getting used to the sight of themselves and their colleagues on screen. Executives realised that they could send video messages to their workforces rather than having to convene town halls. </p>
<p>疫情将视频嵌入了工作场所。以前从未出现在镜头前的员工突然要花上一天中的每一个小时来习惯自己和同事出现在屏幕上。高管们意识到，他们可以向员工发送视频信息，而不必在大厅里召开会议。</p>
<p><strong>There is no going back.</strong> Blogs have become vlogs. Meetings are now recorded <strong>as a matter of cours</strong>e, so that people can <u>fail to watch them back later</u>. Some firms routinely ask applicants to record answers to certain questions on video, so that people can see how well prospective recruits communicate. </p>
<p>没有回头路了。博客变成了视频博客。现在，录制会议是理所当然的事情，这样人们以后就可以稍后再看回放了。一些公司会例行要求应聘者将某些问题的答案录成视频，这样人们就可以看到潜在候选人的沟通能力。</p>
<p>Since video has become more central to work, it pays to be good at it. Being a star in the video age means having the right set-up, speaking well and listening well. Workers can improve <strong><u><em>under their own steam</em></u></strong>, but companies can help, too.</p>
<p>由于视频在工作中变得越来越重要，擅长视频是值得的。在视频时代，成为“明星”意味着要有正确的配置，善于表达，也善于聆听。员工可以通过凭借自己的努力来提高，但公司也可以提供帮助。</p>
<p>To see what the right set-up looks like, just observe the range of images on your next video-conferencing call. It will probably be a complete mishmash. Some people will be bathed in the warm glow of a ring light; others will be emerging from the shadows like the Emperor Palpatine. Some will have high-definition cameras that show off every pore and follicle; others will be smeared across the screen. Some will be Hollywood types, observing the rule of thirds by positioning themselves slightly off-centre; others seem to have learned their craft from “The Blair Witch Project”. </p>
<p>要了解正确的配置是什么样的，只需在下次视频会议电话中观察图像的范围。图像范围内很可能是大杂烩。有的人会沐浴在温暖的环形光环中;其他人则会像帕尔帕廷皇帝一样从阴影中走出来。有些会有高清摄像头，能够展示每个毛孔和毛囊; 其他人在屏幕上是模糊的。有些人是好莱坞式的，通过稍微偏离中心的位置来遵守三分法; 其他人似乎是从《女巫布莱尔》中学来的。【灯光、摄像头、大小】</p>
<p>There is a limit to how level the playing-field between home offices can be, when living arrangements between employees differ so greatly. Not everyone needs to look like an A-lister: people who regularly make presentations or see clients have greater claim on fancier gear. Some people are photogenic, others less so. But this range in video quality can nonetheless be narrowed. </p>
<p>当员工之间的居住安排差异很大时，家庭办公室之间的竞争环境是有限的。并不是每个人都需要看起来像一个一线明星: 定期做演讲或会见客户的人更有资格拥有更华丽的装备。有些人很上镜，有些人则不然。但视频质量的这一范围仍然可以缩小。</p>
<p>A study published last year by Katherine Karl of the University of Tennessee and her co-authors looked at workers’ most common complaints about video-conferencing meetings: camera angles, proximity to the screen and bad lighting all feature in the list of frustrations. Whether providing decent home-working equipment or just giving feedback on how people appear on screen, employers can help everyone improve their video game. </p>
<p>田纳西大学的凯瑟琳·卡尔和她的共同作者去年发表了一项研究，调查了员工对视频会议最常见的抱怨: 摄像头角度、离屏幕太近、光线不好，这些都在不满列表中。无论是提供体面的家庭办公设备，还是仅仅就人们在屏幕上的表现给出反馈，雇主都可以帮助每个人改进他们的视频竞赛。</p>
<p>Advice on how to present well on video is not that different to advice on presenting in general. But there are some specific pitfalls with video. One is where to look. Staring into the camera is unnatural; some advise pinning a photo of someone you respect right by the lens (whether you would really use the opportunity to talk to Volodymyr Zelensky to tell him about your product road map is another question). But looking at the camera is harder if you are referring to notes on the screen at the same time. The speaker whose eyes dart from one to the other is in fear of imminent attack; the speaker who gazes at a point somewhere just off to the left of the camera is appearing in “The Office”. Teleprompter software may be the right answer.</p>
<p>关于如何在视频上做演讲的建议和一般演讲的建议并没有什么不同。但视频也有一些特殊的陷阱。一个是你该看向哪里。盯着镜头是不自然的;一些人建议把你尊敬的人的照片贴在镜头旁(你是否真的会利用这个机会与弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基交谈，告诉他你的产品路线图是另一个问题)。但如果你同时看着屏幕上的笔记，看镜头就更难了。说话的人，目光从一个人转到另一个人，是害怕即将到来的“攻击”; 那个盯着摄像机左边某个点的说话者出现在《办公室》中。提词器软件可能是正确的答案。</p>
<p>Another danger lies in the temptation to use technology just because it is there. The same rule of thumb that should stop you exploring the animations menu in PowerPoint also applies to pre-recorded video. Don’t do jump cuts or special effects unless you really know what you are doing. This is not “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Quarters”. </p>
<p>另一个危险在于仅仅因为技术的存在就想要使用它的诱惑。同样的经验法则应该会阻止你在PowerPoint中探索动画菜单，同样适用于预先录制的视频。除非你真的知道自己在做什么，否则不要做跳跃剪辑或特效。这不是电影《两杆大烟枪》。</p>
<p>Perhaps the least recognised skill in the video age is listening well. After all, one of the great boons of the virtual meeting is that you can get actual work done in it—being able to turn your camera off when your time is being royally wasted may be the pandemic’s greatest gift to productivity. And at the other end of the scale, one of video’s great downsides is how distracting it can be: as well as checking yourself out and following the online chat, you can critique someone’s new wallpaper while watching their next-tile neighbour shovel noodles into their mouth. It takes real effort to stay focused in such circumstances. </p>
<p>在视频时代，最不被认可的技能或许是善于倾听。毕竟，虚拟会议的最大好处之一是你可以在会议中完成实际工作——当你的时间被大量浪费时，你可以关掉相机，这可能是疫情对生产力的最大礼物。另一方面，视频的一大缺点是它太分散人的注意力: 除了查看自己的状态和关注在线聊天，你还可以一边评论别人的新壁纸，一边看着隔壁的邻居往嘴里塞面条。在这种情况下，要保持专注是需要付出很大努力的。</p>
<p><strong>The wrong way for</strong> firms to tackle the problem of inattentiveness is to insist that cameras stay on or use artificial intelligence to analyse the sentiment of meeting participants in real time. As if life were not intolerable enough, imagine having to nod and smile dementedly the whole time in case an algorithm decides you are insufficiently engaged. <strong>The right way for</strong> companies to respond is to make meetings shorter and more relevant. Whether you are on camera or in the room, it is always easier to listen when there is something worth hearing.■</p>
<p>企业解决注意力不集中问题的方法是坚持让摄像头一直开着，或者使用人工智能实时分析会议参与者的情绪，这是错误的。好像生活还不够让人难以忍受似的，想象一下，为了防止算法判定你不够投入，你不得不一直疯狂地点头和微笑。企业应对的正确方式是让会议更短、更切题。无论你是在镜头前还是在房间里，当有值得听的东西时，倾听总是更容易。</p>
